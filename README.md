# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

In this week I set up Git, Github, Slack and some other stuff for class.

I also learned how to use Markdown. 
- \# to make a heading.
- \## to make a subheading, add more \# will make subheading smaller.
- Put "\_" or "\*" at beginning and the end to make text italic.
- Use "\__" or "\**" to make text bold.
- Use "\```" at beginning and end to make text look like code.
